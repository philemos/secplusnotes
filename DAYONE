Business Processes Impacting Security Operations
----Business processes are the organized steps that companies use to achieve their goals or provide services effectively.
-----Impact on security operations
------If the approval process isn't robust, it could lead to changes that introduce vulnerabilities.
------Clear ownership protocols ensure that each asset has someone responsible for its security.

Approval Process, Ownership, and Stakeholders
----The approval process determines how security-affecting changes are authorized and who has the authority to make those decisions.
----Ownership refers to the individual or team responsible for specific assets and accountable for their security.
----Stakeholders are individuals or groups with a vested interest in an organization’s security practices.

Impact Analysis & Test Results##planformurphy
----Impact analysis involves evaluating the potential effects of changes on an organization’s security landscape.
----Test results from activities like penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and simulated attacks provide critical insights into the effectiveness of newly implemented security measures.

Backout Plan, Maintenance Window, & Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
--A backout plan is a detailed procedure aimed at reversing changes that negatively affect security or business operations in IT systems or processes.
--A maintenance window is a scheduled timeframe for implementing system updates or changes, chosen strategically to minimize disruptions.
--SOPs are step-by-step instruction sets designed to guide workers through complex routine operations, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.

technical implications
---Technical implications encompass the potential consequences of technology-related decisions or events within the cybersecurity landscape.
----Examples
-----Changes to network infrastructure
-----Adjustments to security protocols
-----Requirements for increasing server capacity due to new software or systems

Allow Lists & Block Lists/Deny Lists
Allow lists or whitelists are lists of approved inputs that are permitted to be entered on a system.
Block lists or deny lists are collections of specific elements, characters, or patterns that cannot be input.

Restricted Activities
Restricted activities are specific actions or operations within a computer or network system that are limited or prohibited to maintain cybersecurity standards.
These restrictions are typically introduced during employee onboarding through key documentation like acceptable use policies (AUPs).

Downtime, Service Restart, & Application Restart
Downtime refers to periods when a system, network, or software application is unavailable.
Service restart involves stopping and restarting a system service to implement updates, patches, or configuration changes.
An application restart is like a service restart but it involves restarting a specific software application.

Legacy Applications and Dependencies
Legacy applications are older software programs that continue to play a critical role in an organization's operations.
Dependencies are relationships in which one component or service relies on another for proper functioning.

Documentation
Documentation is written material that provides information about systems or processes.
Examples
User guides
Technical specifications
System descriptions

Updating Diagrams
Diagrams serve as maps or blueprints of networks or process flowcharts, providing visual representations.
Updating diagrams involves editing existing diagrams of systems or networks to reflect any changes since the diagrams’ creation.
Poorly documented changes can lead to instability and downtime.

Updating Policies/Procedures
Policies dictate the rules governing the use and security of IT systems. Procedures outline the specific steps to implement these rules.
Regular revision of policies and procedures is essential to keep them aligned with technological advancements, environmental changes, or system modifications.

Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes made to a file or set of files over time.
Allows users to:
Track modifications
Identify when and by whom changes were made
Revert to earlier versions if necessary

Topics
Public Key Infrastructure
  Public key infrastructure (PKI) encompasses key management, certificate authorities (CAs), intermediate CAs, and registration authorities (RAs).
  PKI enables secure connections for websites, email transmissions, and remote access by utilizing asymmetric key pairs consisting of public and private keys.
  Private keys are kept secret, while public keys can be distributed. Private key escrow may be provided by trusted third parties.

Encryption
  Encryption converts information into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access.
  Different levels of encryption offer varying degrees of protection.
    Full-disk encryption secures an entire hard drive, including data, files, and the operating system.
    Partition encryption involves treating portions of a disk as separate units. 
    File encryption, or encrypting individual files, adds an additional layer of security. 

Transport/Communication
  Data security and encryption is essential, whether the data is at rest, in transit, or in use.

Symmetric Versus Asymmetric Encryption
  Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption. 
  Asymmetric encryption employs a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Key Exchange
  Key exchange, also known as key establishment, is a cryptographic process that enables two parties to exchange cryptographic keys.

Algorithms
  Algorithms: Mathematical formulas used in cryptographic processes

Key Length
  Key length: The number of bits in an encryption algorithm's key; longer keys typically provide stronger encryption

Tools
  Tools: Specialized technologies and protocols for securing and managing digital information throughout its lifecycle

Trusted Platform Module
  Trusted Platform Module (TPM): A hardware-based security technology using a secure cryptoprocessor chip to execute cryptographic operations, generate and manage cryptographic keys, authenticate platform devices, and ensure platform integrity by storing security measurements

Hardware Security Module
  Hardware Security Module (HSM): A physical device serving as a secure cryptoprocessor, providing faster encryption than software-based solutions, and generally tamper-proof 

Key Management System:A Key Management System (KMS) safeguards digital data by managing codes used to lock and unlock data
Main functions:
  Generates cryptographic keys
  Stores keys securely
  Exchanges keys
  Key use and access control
  Key replacement and rotation

Secure Enclave:A secure enclave is a hardware-based feature found in devices like iPhones.
  It segregates encryption tasks and runs on a separate microprocessor with its own operating system.
  Designed to resist tampering, it prevents access to its data through strict protocols.
  The enclave is resistant to software and hardware attacks.

Obfuscation:Obfuscation: A technique used to protect sensitive information by altering or disguising the original data to prevent easy comprehension or access by unauthorized users

Steganography: The practice of concealing secret messages within seemingly innocuous carriers
  Audio steganography
  Video steganography
  Image steganography

Hashing: A one-way function that maps data to a fixed-length value, primarily for authentication and ensuring data integrity by verifying that it hasn't been altered

Salting:Salting: Adding random data to a password before hashing to enhance security 

Digital Signatures:A mathematical scheme used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document
  Three algorithms used in a digital signature:
    Key generation algorithm
    Signing algorithm
    Signature verifying algorithm
  Two properties required for a digital signature:
    Authenticity verification
    Private key

Key Stretching: A cryptographic technique used to enhance the security of weak keys against brute-force attacks 
  Salt: Randomly generated data added to a password before hashing to prevent the same password from producing the same hash value
  Pepper: Another randomly generated value added to a password hash, kept secret and separate from the hashed password

Blockchain:A secure and immutable digital ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computer systems in a decentralized manner
   Prevents alteration or fraud

Open Public Ledger:: A component of blockchain technology that organizes transaction information into blocks that are chained together chronologically
  Verifies transaction authenticity
  Prevents double spending without the need for a central authority

Certificates:A digital document issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify the identity of the certificate holder and ensure the legitimacy of online communications
  Certificate Authorities (CA): Entities, typically servers, responsible for issuing certificates to users in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, serving as trusted third parties to validate identities and secure digital exchanges
