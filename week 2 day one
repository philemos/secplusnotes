ATTESTAION
remote attestation

sim vs e-sim example

ACCESS
rbac (role based acess control) (godmode)
rule based acess control(law is god)
MAC(mandatory access control) predetemined on cpu, think scif
DAC (aceess is detemined by owner, like a dictator)
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) == if then,kinda like rules but not really

Understanding the Importance of Automation and Orchestration Related to Secure Operations

Use Cases of Automation and Scripting

Benefits

Other Considerations

User Provisioning can be autmoated, Resource Provisioning can be automated, Guard Rails
can be automated,

A security group is a collection of users that are categorized based on security policies,
which can be automatically updated or modified to grant or restrict access to particular system
resources

Ticket Creation and Escalation

Ticket Creation and Escalation
Automation also simplifies the ticket creation and escalation process in incident response
scenarios. An automated ticket creation system can detect an irregularity, such as an 
unauthorized login attempt, and create a ticket or an incident report in a system used for
tracking issues, problems, or activities that require attention or action

Continuous Integration and Testing
Continuous integration and testing, or continuous integration and continuous testing (CI/CT),
involves regular, automated integration of code changes, contributed by multiple developers,
into a single repository, followed by an immediate series of rigorous automated tests to ensure
code quality and security.

Integrations and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Integrations and application programming interfaces (APIs) refer to the automated linking
of different computing services and software applications to work as a coherent system, 
often with APIs that allow different software entities to communicate with each other
