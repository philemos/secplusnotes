chapter four/ daytwo

ceaser cioher is a substitution cipher
sha1 or 2 stronger @ definenetly sha 2, sha 1 is obsolete. in 2017 google and cwi amsterdam performed an attack and collisoion on sha1 and proved it obsolte
md5 is also no bueno

checksum is crucial for security and used for checking hashes 

media access controller
message authenticaion code
salt and pepper make security clever
whats ccmp ----|
               |----CTM(counter mode);CBC(cipher block chain);MAC(message authenticaion code);PROTOCOL()
whats hmac---Hash-based Message Authentication Code
Itâ€™s a MAC (Message Authentication Code) that uses a hash function (like SHA-256) and a secret key to produce a tamper-evident message tag.

infrastructure as a service just gives the cutomer the structure, or virtual, sd hardware/hardware /space to work

platform as aservice is like the operating system, and gives the customer thsi os to wokr on (developers love it)

saas, software as aservice is the mostr restricve methods of cloud computing

security as a service is just what cyber teh do pretty muh like remote security it

public private hybrid and community environments

public cloud; likee freeweb email services; everyone shares it
private cloud: you and ayou alone, or simply witihin an organization
community cloud: institutuions within the same industry that use that same cloud, like hte medical industry
hybrid cloud: a mix of any of the two or all three

malware attacks: does whatever the dev says...ransomware is king,social engineering first...trojan hores is designed to look like a legitimate website/app...
remote access trojan=rat, crweates a backdoor...bloatware consumes lots of resourcestoo make it move as though it were fat... spyware just monitors...
worms are like maggot, self repilicating, regrowing,healing...viruses infect and spread copies of themselves throughout system...keylogegers steal sensitive infomartion...
logicboms (two types 1) timebased 2)event based )intiarew malicoius functions under specific places...rootkits gain admin level...
